# Code-ML
All of them are traditional methods in ML.

## Linear Regression
The linear regression task involves finding the relation between *price* and *sqft_living* in *train.csv*. Then the house price is predicted in *test.csv* and the RMSE (root mean square error) are calculated.<br> 
What's more, three different methods are applied in order to compare the effectiveness of each fitting function.

## Naive Bayes
A simple spam email classifier based on Naive Bayes.

## Multiple Layer Perceptron
Two different classifiers are formed by building a typical MLP, one for distinguishing between O and X, and the other for distinguishing between O and D. The first 70% data are used as the training set while the remaining 30% is for testing.
